# render_thousands_items_react

The structure that i will build 👍

i will build a table component that holds (10,000)thousands of items without the collaboration with the bad performance that caused from each rendering  

Pesudo code :👍

1- initialize the application with npx command 
2- create dommy data as a list that holds (10,000) items 
3- passing the whole data as props to the specific components that will render that list 
4- creating a Table component that will holds that list 
5- implement the functionality of the virtualized list to render the list with the best performance 
6- make the each row in the table editable
